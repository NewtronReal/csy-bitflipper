there is a hardware device emulator which has two 256 bit registers the first 256bit register is locked from external access but second 256bit register can be accessed by gpio0,1,2 pins

the locked register contains a flag value(any flag which has 32 characters) and second register is initialized to 1 by default on applying a voltage of 3.3v on each gpio pins

0 pin lshifts the register by 1
1 pin rshifts the register by 1
2 pin takes the 1's complement of the register

the device gets unlocked only if the locked register is set to 0

make a react js project and files which emulates this hardware
